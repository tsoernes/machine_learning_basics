# Machine learning basics

This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Rust. 
All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries.
The intention is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure,
*not* to provide the most efficient implementations.
